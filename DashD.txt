Didn't know this was in #HCR bill: a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services.

It is great to know that there are people who care about #HCR and not what's going on in #Tigersbedroom ....

Okay, this is a done deal. Anybody knows a good spot to watch the end of the world, before things go back to normal tomorrow? #hcr

To those in US who r working so hard to deny 32 million people what should be a basic right of citizenship - shame on you. #hcr

Nobody wants to be the deciding vote on the most historic, compassionate, and moral legislation ever. #hcr

Where was all this public passion when they passed the Patriot Act (and really did erode our liberty)? #hcr

My closing argument for #healthreform: It's about a lot more than health care. http://bit.ly/cgo1an #hcr #tcot #politics

Why don't the people against #HCR just confess to the fact that they are in love with the idea of genocide?

The passage of this #hcr takeover lays in the hands of just a few Dems, we are keeping the heat on them and you should too. Speak up!

RT @SamiShamieh: Like it or not, the only people standing for liberty right now ARE Republicans. They deserve credit! #tcot #HCR

and did Rep. Smith really just say #hcr will mean more ''dead babies'' .... #myheadhurts

RT @1nv1ctus RT @chelseablobs: How can Republicans be 'pro-life' when they are letting innocent people die by not voting for #HCR ? #c-span

also, I <3 Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY). #p2 #hcr

I can't see why #HCR would NOT be passed! What's the alternative?!? The status quo with morbidity

Norm Ornstein: ''If Tom Daschle had been confirmed before Tim Geithner, you would have seen a #hcr signing ceremony 4 months ago.'' I agree.

For every minute the house continues to argue about #HCR... TWO more people die of heart attacks.

According to my pal Tim Noah, who's been covering #hcr for Slate, passage of the bill is all but a done deal as of now.Please be right, Tim.

I wonder how many of those #hcr protestors took the government run public transportation to get to their anti govt rally?

Seriously, Republicans shouldn't be so dismayed. After all we're talking about helping more Americans get health coverage #hcr

Although electoral consequences of #hcr are highly uncertain, how many GOPers will go to bed tonight feeling remotely good about this?

Another reason to pass #HCR: If Obama can pull this off, he can start acting like he actually has a mandate

There is hope for America #hcr #herman

I can't imagine the pressure of living without healthcare, especially for people with children. Who in their right mind would oppose #hcr?
